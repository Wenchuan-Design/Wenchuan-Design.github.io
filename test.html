            Michelangelo was born on the sixth of March, 1475, at Caprese, in Casentino, of the ancient family of the Buonarroti-Simoni, who are mentioned in the Florentine chronicles from the twelfth century. His father, Lodovico di Lionardo Buonarroti-Simoni, was then Podesta of Caprese and Chiusi. His mother, Francesca di Neri di Miniato del Sera, died when he was only six years old, and some years later his father married Lucrezia Ubaldini. Michelangelo had four brothers: Lionardo, who was two years his senior; Buonarroto, born in 1477; Giovan Simoni, born in 1479; and Sigismondo, born in 1481. His foster-mother was the wife of a stone-cutter of Settignano and in later years he used to jokingly attribute his vocation to the milk upon which he had been nourished. He was sent to school in Florence under Francesco da Urbino, but he busied himself only in drawing and neglected everything else. &quot;Because of this he greatly irritated his father and his uncles, and they often beat him cruelly, for they hated the profession of an artist, and, in their ignorance of the nobility of art, it seemed a disgrace to have one in the house.&quot;

            杰思罗·艾克森·萨姆纳是北卡罗莱纳州的一位地主兼商人，曾在美国独立战争期间担任大陆军军官。萨姆纳生于弗吉尼亚殖民地，在法国－印第安人战争期间加入殖民地军队。这场战争结束后，他迁居北卡罗莱纳殖民地比特县，在此获得了大量土地并经营着一家酒馆。他曾出任比特县警长一职，但随着美国革命拉开帷幕，他成为坚定的爱国者，还曾入选北卡罗莱纳省议会。1776年，萨姆纳成为大陆军北卡罗莱纳第3团司令官，先后在南方战场和费城战役冲锋陷阵。美国革命期间，大陆军中共有过5位北卡罗莱纳殖民地准将，萨姆纳便是其中之一，从1779年任职到1783年。他在斯托诺弗里战役和尤托泉战役中表现英勇，但反复发作的健康问题经常迫使他无法冲锋陷阵，只能处理行政工作或是回到北卡罗莱纳静养。大陆军中的北卡罗莱纳将士在查尔斯顿围城战和卡姆登战役后已所剩无几，萨姆纳成为北卡罗莱纳民兵将领，但很快因不满殖民地战争议会将民兵指挥权交给外来军官而辞职抗议。1783年战争结束后，萨姆纳帮助建立了辛辛那提协会北卡罗莱纳分会并担任首任主席。1785年3月中旬，杰思罗·艾克森·萨姆纳在沃伦县谢世，享年52岁。图为吉尔福德法院国家军事公园中的杰思罗·萨姆纳纪念碑，1891年萨姆纳移葬于此。

        <p>The elder Buonarroti, however, was, like his son, more violent than obstinate, and he soon allowed the boy to follow his vocation. In April, 1488, Michelangelo, by the advice of Francesco Granacci, entered the studio of Domenico and David Ghirlandajo.</p>

        <p>It has been said that his influence on Michelangelo amounted to nothing, and it is true that we find no direct trace of it except in two drawings in the Louvre and the Albertina. Still, exact imitation is very rare with Michelangelo. He was made of too stubborn stuff ever to be much affected by masters or surroundings. He felt contempt for Raphael because he was impressionable, &quot;and drew his superiority not from nature, but from study.&quot; I do not believe, however, that the time he spent in the school of Ghirlandajo had no effect upon him. Even if it did not influence his style or his method of working, he must have gained from the master of S. Maria Novella and from his wholesome work a healthy point of view and a physical and moral vigour which could have been given him by no other artist in Florence—not even the two great sculptors, Pollajuolo and Verrocchio, who were indeed not there at that time—and which acted as a powerful balance to the neuroticism of the Botticellian school. I do not doubt that Ghirlandajo helped to lay the foundations from which arose the art of the young Michelangelo devoted to the expression of force and so contemptuous of morbid sentiment.</p>

        <p class="id" id='test'>That was the most famous studio in Florence. Domenico was an indefatigable worker who &quot;longed to cover with stories the entire circuit of the walls of Florence&quot; and possessed of a calm, simple and serene spirit, satisfied merely to exist without tormenting itself over subtleties. This fortunate being, who died at forty-four, leaving an immense mass of completed work in which the magnificence and the moral force of Florence still live, was the best guide that could have been given to the young Michelangelo. Domenico was then, from 1486 to 1490, in the fulness of his power, and at work on his masterpiece, the paintings in the Tornabuoni Chapel in S. Maria Novella.</p>

I do not doubt that Ghirlandajo helped to lay the foundations from which arose the art of the young Michelangelo devoted to the expression of force and so contemptuous of morbid sentiment.</p>

        <p>Ghirlandajo&#39;s school was enthusiastically open-minded toward everything interesting in art. It was eclectic and encouraged intellectual curiosity. Michelangelo while he was there studied passionately both the old and the new Florentine painters and sculptors: Giotto,<sup><a>[2]</a></sup> Masaccio,<sup><a>[3]</a></sup> Donatello, Ghiberti, Benedetto da Majano, Mino da Fiesole, Antonio Rossellino and possibly, even at that time, Jacopo della Quercia and also the Flemish and the German artists, then very much in vogue in Italy, especially at the court of the Medici.<sup><a>[4]</a></sup> He made a copy in colour of Martin Schongauer&#39;s Temptation of St. Anthony and went to the Florentine fish-market to take notes for it. Later on he contemptuously disowned Flemish realism, but a trace of it was left in him always and in many of his drawings there appears a certain taste, extraordinary in an idealist, for types of marked naturalism which are sometimes trivial or almost caricature. Condivi asserts that these first attempts of Michelangelo met with such success that Ghirlandajo grew jealous.</p>

        <p>&quot;To take from him the credit of this copy (of the Schongauer) Ghirlandajo used to say that it came out of his atelier, as if he had had a part in it. This jealousy showed very clearly when Michelangelo asked him for the book of drawings wherein he had sketched shepherds with their flocks and dogs, landscapes, monuments, ruins, etc., and he refused to lend it to him. As a matter of fact, he always had the reputation of being rather jealous, because of his disagreeable treatment not only of Michelangelo, but also of his own brother, for when he saw the latter making good progress and showing great promise, he sent him to France, not so much for his benefit, as has been alleged, as that he himself might remain first in his art at Florence. I have mentioned this,&quot; adds Condivi, &quot;because it has been said to me that Domenico&#39;s son was in the habit of attributing the divine excellence of Michelangelo to the training given by his father, who really did not help him in any way. It is true that Michelangelo never complained of him, but on the contrary praised him as much for his art as for his conduct.&quot;</p>
